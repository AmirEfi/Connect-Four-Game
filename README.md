# Connect4 Game
## Final project of the AI course - Spring 2023

This is a simple Connect4 game.

You can play in two modes: Single/Multiplayer.

The single-player is an AI with 3 levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

The AI player plays based on a Minimax algorithm, and the depth of the tree goes deeper as the level goes harder.
